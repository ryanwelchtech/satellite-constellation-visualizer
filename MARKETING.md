# Marketing Materials - Satellite Constellation Visualizer

Space is the ultimate high ground. And the engineers who understand it will define the next era of defense. 🛰️

I built a **Satellite Constellation Visualizer**—a 3D orbital visualization platform that tracks real satellite constellations including GPS, SBIRS, WGS, and reconnaissance assets.

What you can explore:
✅ Interactive 3D Earth with animated satellite orbits
✅ 5 defense-critical constellations (GPS, Starlink, SBIRS, WGS, NRO)
✅ Orbital parameters: altitude, inclination, period, velocity
✅ Ground station network with coverage mapping
✅ Real-time constellation filtering and satellite selection

Space Domain Awareness isn't just a buzzword—it's becoming essential for national security. Understanding orbital mechanics, constellation architecture, and ground-space communication links is foundational.

Built with React, Three.js, React Three Fiber, and TypeScript. Runs entirely in the browser—no backend required. 🚀

Whether you're in defense, aerospace, or just fascinated by what's orbiting above us, this tool makes the invisible visible.

Which constellation do you think is most critical to national security? I'd argue GPS—everything from precision munitions to financial systems depends on it. 🤔
